# Code Your Future: Student tracking system

## About
Project developed as part of one day Women Driven Development Expedia hackaton on 15th March 2019.


#### The tool:
We want to create a remote monitoring system that automatically logs some basic activity of students in the public Slack channels so that students can understand what actions and frequency they should be aiming for. 
This would also help instructors understand which students need most attention.

#### Techonology:
* [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/), Java 8. backend technology
